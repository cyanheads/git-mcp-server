# Git MCP Server Development Tools: Test Analysis Report

**Test Date:** 2025-10-10
**Test Environment:** `/Users/casey/Developer/git-mcp-test`

This report summarizes the functional status of the tools provided by the `git-mcp-server-development` server based on a series of systematic tests.

---

## 1. Summary of Findings

The server tools exhibit mixed reliability. While many core and advanced features are functional, several critical tools for repository inspection and cloning are broken, which can significantly impact developer workflow. Other tools exhibit minor issues, such as misleading or incomplete output.

### Key Issues Identified:
- **Critical Failure in `git_branch` and `git_log`:** Read operations that rely on a specific internal command format (`--format=%(refname)...`) are failing due to "Unsafe shell character" errors. This prevents listing branches or reliably filtering logs.
- **Critical Failure in `git_clone`:** The tool fails to locate the `git` executable (`posix_spawn 'git' ENOENT`), making it completely non-functional. This blocks testing of `pull` and `fetch`.
- **Schema Validation Issues:** `git_remote` initially failed due to strict URI validation on a local file path, indicating correct schema enforcement but a potential usability issue for local development workflows.
- **Inconsistent Response Formatting:** Several tools (`git_commit`, `git_rebase`, `git_blame`) return misleading or incomplete information in their human-readable output, even when the underlying Git operation succeeds.

## 2. Detailed Tool Status

### ‚úÖ Fully Functional Tools

These tools and their tested operations performed as expected.

-   **`git_set_working_dir`**: Successfully set the session's working directory.
-   **`git_init`**: Successfully initialized both standard and bare repositories.
-   **`git_status`**: Correctly reported clean, untracked, modified, and staged states.
-   **`git_add`**: Successfully staged new and modified files.
-   **`git_show`**: Correctly displayed commit details and diffs.
-   **`git_checkout`**: Successfully switched between branches.
-   **`git_merge`**: Successfully performed a fast-forward merge.
-   **`git_branch` (create, delete)**: Successfully created and deleted branches.
-   **`git_remote` (add)**: Successfully added a remote repository once the URL was corrected to the `file://` URI format.
-   **`git_push`**: Successfully pushed commits to the remote repository.
-   **`git_diff`**: Correctly displayed unstaged changes between the working directory and HEAD.
-   **`git_stash` (push, pop, list)**: Successfully stashed, listed, and restored changes.
-   **`git_reset`**: Successfully unstaged files using the `mixed` mode.
-   **`git_cherry_pick`**: Successfully applied a specific commit from another branch.
-   **`git_tag` (create)**: Successfully created an annotated tag.
-   **`git_reflog`**: Correctly displayed the history of HEAD movements.
-e   **`git_worktree` (add, list)**: Successfully added and listed worktrees after correcting the initial branch usage error.

### üü° Partially Functional Tools (Minor Issues)

These tools completed their operations but exhibited issues in their output.

-   **`git_commit`**: The tool successfully creates commits, but the response formatter incorrectly reports "Files Changed: 0" in the output. The commit itself is valid.
-   **`git_rebase`**: The operation succeeded, but the response message "Commits Rebased: 0" was misleading. The log confirmed that the rebase had in fact occurred correctly.
-   **`git_blame`**: The tool worked but appeared to truncate its output, showing only 2 out of 3 lines of a modified file.

### ‚ùå Broken or Critically Flawed Tools

These tools failed to perform their core function.

-   **`git_branch` (list, show-current)**: **CRITICAL.** Both operations fail with `Error: Git unknown failed: Unsafe shell character detected in git argument: --format=%(refname)...`. This prevents fundamental repository inspection.
-   **`git_clone`**: **CRITICAL.** Fails with `Error: Git clone failed: ENOENT: no such file or directory, posix_spawn 'git'`. The tool cannot find the Git executable, making it impossible to clone repositories.
-   **`git_log` (branch filter)**: **MAJOR.** The `branch` parameter does not work. The tool ignores the filter and always displays the log for the currently checked-out branch.

### ‚¨õ Blocked / Untested Tools

Testing for these tools was blocked by failures in their dependencies.

-   **`git_pull` / `git_fetch`**: Testing was blocked by the critical failure of `git_clone`, as a separate cloned repository is required to properly test fetching and pulling updates.

## 3. Recommendations

1.  **Prioritize `git_branch` and `git_log` Fixes:** The "Unsafe shell character" error is a high-priority bug. The internal command formatting used by these tools needs to be revised to use shell-safe characters.
2.  **Investigate `git_clone` `ENOENT` Error:** The pathing or environment variable setup for the `git_clone` tool's execution context is likely incorrect, preventing it from finding the `git` binary. This is a critical failure.
3.  **Review Response Formatter Logic:** The formatters for `git_commit`, `git_rebase`, and `git_blame` should be reviewed to ensure they provide accurate and complete information that reflects the true result of the underlying Git operation.
4.  **Enhance `git_remote` UX:** Consider allowing local file paths directly in the `url` parameter for `git_remote` or provide a more descriptive error message to guide users toward the `file://` URI format.
