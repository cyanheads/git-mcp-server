# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## v2.4.9 - 2025-10-13

### Added

- **Configurable Git Identity**: Introduced support for setting Git author and committer information via environment variables (e.g., `GIT_AUTHOR_NAME`, `GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL`). The server now automatically uses these values, with a fallback to the user's global Git configuration if they are not set. This allows for consistent identity management across all Git operations.
- **Expanded Commit Signing**: Extended GPG/SSH signing capabilities to all commit-creating operations. Signing can now be enabled for `git merge`, `git rebase`, `git cherry-pick`, and `git tag` in addition to `git commit`.

### Changed

- **Internal Refactor**: Centralized the logic for handling Git identity and commit signing within the command builder (`command-builder.ts`) and a new configuration helper (`config-helper.ts`). This ensures that all Git operations consistently use the configured identity and signing settings.
- **Documentation**: Updated `README.md` and `.env.example` to provide clear documentation and examples for the new Git identity and expanded signing features.
- **Version**: Bumped the package version to `2.4.9`.

## v2.4.8 - 2025-10-13

### Fixed

- **Package Scripts**: Reorganized `package.json` scripts section to match template structure, fixing stdio transport connection issues. Removed comment separators that could interfere with script execution and reordered scripts in the proper sequence (build → deploy → start → dev). Added missing `rebuild` script.
- **Transport Detection**: Resolved issue where MCP clients (like Cursor) would show red connection indicator despite successful tool/resource registration when using stdio transport.

### Changed

- **Script Organization**: Scripts now follow consistent ordering pattern matching the mcp-ts-template for better maintainability and cross-project consistency.

## v2.4.7 - 2025-10-13

### Added

- **Cross-Runtime Compatibility**: The server now officially supports both **Bun** and **Node.js** runtimes. A new runtime detection mechanism (`src/utils/internal/runtime.ts`) and a runtime adapter for Git command execution (`src/services/git/providers/cli/utils/runtime-adapter.ts`) have been added. This ensures optimal performance by using `Bun.spawn` in the Bun runtime and `child_process.spawn` in the Node.js runtime.
- **Runtime Logging**: The server now logs the detected runtime environment on startup for easier debugging and support.

### Changed

- **Documentation**: Updated `README.md` to reflect the new cross-runtime compatibility, providing clear instructions and configuration examples for both `bunx` and `npx`.
- **Dependencies**: Updated several dependencies to their latest versions, including `hono`, `repomix`, and `vite`.

## v2.4.6 - 2025-10-11

### Changed

- **Documentation**: Polished the `README.md` to improve clarity and consistency across the "Tools," "Resources," and "Prompts" sections.
- **Configuration**: Refined the `package.json` file by organizing scripts into logical groups, alphabetizing keywords, and simplifying the project description for better readability.

## v2.4.5 - 2025-10-11

### Added

- **Tilde Expansion Support**: Configuration now supports tilde (`~`) expansion in path environment variables for improved developer experience. Applies to `LOGS_DIR`, `STORAGE_FILESYSTEM_PATH`, `GIT_WRAPUP_INSTRUCTIONS_PATH`, and `GIT_BASE_DIR`. Supports both `~/path` (expands to `homedir/path`) and `~` alone (expands to `homedir`).
- **Enhanced Git Branch Filtering**: The `git_branch` tool now accepts commit references for `merged` and `noMerged` parameters. Users can specify a commit hash or branch name to filter branches (e.g., `merged: "main"` shows branches merged into main, not just HEAD).
- **Shared Formatter Utility**: Extracted duplicate `flattenChanges` helper function into shared utility module (`git-formatters.ts`) for better code reuse across git tools.

### Fixed

- **Documentation Typo**: Corrected agent meta files reference in `git_wrapup_instructions` tool from `.clinerules` to `.cline_rules`.

### Changed

- **Version Bump**: Updated version from 2.4.4 to 2.4.5 in package.json and README.md.
- **Code Refactoring**: Consolidated duplicate change flattening logic from `git_add` and `git_commit` tools into the shared `flattenChanges` utility, improving maintainability.
- **Documentation**: Updated tree.md to reflect addition of `git-formatters.ts` utility.
- **README Examples**: Enhanced README with more comprehensive configuration examples including git username, email, base directory, and logs directory settings.

## v2.4.4 - 2025-10-11

### Added

- **Enhanced Repository Context**: The `git_set_working_dir` tool now provides rich repository context by default when setting the working directory. Includes immediate status, branch information, configured remotes, and recent commits. Context gathering can be disabled via the new `includeContext` parameter.
- **Base Directory Security**: New optional `GIT_BASE_DIR` environment variable to restrict all git operations to a specific directory tree. Provides security sandboxing for multi-tenant or shared hosting environments. When configured, prevents git operations from accessing paths outside the specified base directory.

### Changed

- **Configuration**: Updated default HTTP port from 3010 to 3015 across all configuration files (`.env.example`, `src/config/index.ts`, `smithery.yaml`, tests).
- **Documentation**: Enhanced response format documentation in README with comprehensive examples showing both JSON (LLM-optimized) and Markdown (human-readable) output formats. Added detailed explanation of verbosity levels and when to use each format.
- **Documentation**: Clarified tool count (now 27 with addition of `git_clear_working_dir`) and updated Advanced Workflows category to reflect both `git_set_working_dir` and `git_clear_working_dir` tools.
- **Documentation**: Added comprehensive Roadmap section detailing provider-based architecture and planned git provider integrations (CLI via Bun.spawn, isomorphic-git, GitHub API). Includes technical details about current CLI provider implementation (streaming I/O, timeout handling, buffer limits).
- **Documentation**: Enhanced Features section to highlight provider-based architecture and optimized git execution via Bun.spawn with streaming I/O and timeout handling.
- **Branding**: Updated project references from `mcp-ts-template` to `git-mcp-server` in configuration files (`typedoc.json`, `smithery.yaml`, `wrangler.toml`).

### Fixed

- **Import Order**: Corrected import organization in `git-set-working-dir.tool.ts` to follow project conventions (framework imports first, internal imports second).
- **Config Import**: Fixed config import in `git-validators.ts` to use named export pattern with proper TypeScript typing for optional GIT_BASE_DIR value. Added defensive null-safety checks to handle undefined config in test environments.

## v2.4.3 - 2025-10-11

### Fixed

- **Git Branch Tool**: Fixed `git for-each-ref` command construction by correctly placing the command in the `command` parameter instead of args array
- **Git Rebase Tool**: Enhanced `--continue` mode with fallback handling for `--no-edit` option, improving compatibility across different Git versions
- **Git Command Builder**: Fixed environment variable construction to preserve PATH from process.env, ensuring git executable can be found in custom install locations

### Changed

- **Documentation**: Updated tree.md to reflect addition of CLAUDE.md file

## v2.4.2 - 2025-10-10

### Added

- **JSON Response Formatter**: Introduced a new `json-response-formatter` utility (`src/mcp-server/tools/utils/json-response-formatter.ts`) to create LLM-optimized, structured JSON responses for tools. This improves parsing efficiency and reduces token usage compared to Markdown. The formatter supports configurable verbosity levels (`minimal`, `standard`, `full`).

### Changed

- **Tool Architecture**: Refactored all Git tools to align with the new v2.4.0 architecture. All `responseFormatter` implementations now use the new `createJsonFormatter`, and Git command execution is consistently delegated to the `GitProvider` service layer.
- **Test Suite**: Updated the entire test suite to reflect the architectural changes. Test helpers, assertions, and unit tests have been modified to validate structured JSON output instead of Markdown.
- **Configuration**: The `.env.example` file has been updated to include the new `MCP_RESPONSE_VERBOSITY` configuration option.
- **Logging**: The logger (`src/utils/internal/logger.ts`) has been enhanced to include a `notice` level and an improved startup banner.

### Dependencies

- Updated `package.json` and `bun.lock` with the latest versions of project dependencies.

## v2.4.1 - 2025-10-11

### Added

- **Markdown Builder Utility**: Added a fluent interface markdown builder (`src/mcp-server/tools/utils/markdown-builder.ts`) for constructing LLM-optimized response formatters. Provides chainable methods for headings, sections, lists, key-value pairs, and conditional content. Improves consistency and maintainability across all tool response formatters.
- **SDK Context Validation**: Added defensive type guard (`validateSdkContext`) in tool handler factory to validate MCP SDK context structure, catching unexpected issues early and improving robustness.

### Changed

- **Tool Response Formatters**: Refactored `git_add` and `git_commit` response formatters to use the new markdown builder utility, resulting in cleaner, more maintainable code with consistent formatting.
- **Enhanced Tool Output**:
  - `git_add` tool now includes comprehensive repository status after staging, showing all staged changes, remaining unstaged changes, untracked files, and whether the repository is ready to commit.
  - `git_commit` tool response formatter refactored for improved readability and structure using markdown builder.
- **Tool Handler Improvements**:
  - Enhanced dependency injection with closure-based memoization for thread-safe singleton pattern.
  - Added debug mode logging for tool inputs (enabled via `MCP_DEBUG_TOOL_INPUTS=true`).
  - Improved error context logging with more detailed information about failures.
  - Better path resolution with runtime type safety checks and comprehensive logging.
  - Added graceful fallback when path property is unexpectedly missing from tool input.

### Fixed

- **Tool Handler Type Safety**: Improved runtime type checking for tool inputs with path properties, preventing potential type mismatches during working directory resolution.

### Documentation

- **README**: Enhanced formatting and improved documentation structure for prompts and tool responses sections.
- **CHANGELOG**: Consolidated alpha release notes into cohesive v2.4.0 release notes.

### Dependencies

- Updated `@cloudflare/workers-types` to `^4.20251011.0`
- Updated `@types/bun` to `^1.3.0`
- Updated `bun-types` to `^1.3.0`
- Removed unused transitive dependencies from lock file

## v2.4.0 - 2025-10-10

- Aligned with [mcp-ts-template](https://github.com/cyanheads/mcp-ts-template) v2.3.5
- Moved to [Bun](https://bun.sh) for dependency management, scripting, and runtime execution.
- Major architectural refactor to a dual-output tool architecture with structured content and User-optimized responses.

### New Features

- **Git Wrapup Prompt** (`git_wrapup`): A new structured workflow prompt for completing git sessions. Guides users through a systematic protocol including reviewing changes with `git_diff`, updating changelog and documentation, creating logical commits, and optionally creating release tags. Features configurable options for skipping documentation review, creating tags, and updating agent meta files. Integrates with the `git_wrapup_instructions` tool for context-aware workflow generation.
- **Git Blame Tool** (`git_blame`): Show line-by-line authorship information for files, displaying who last modified each line and when. Supports optional line range filtering (`startLine`, `endLine`), whitespace change ignoring, and provides formatted output with commit hash, date, author, and content for each line.
- **Git Reflog Tool** (`git_reflog`): View reference logs (reflog) to track when branch tips and other references were updated. Essential for recovering lost commits and understanding repository history. Supports filtering by specific references (default: HEAD) and configurable entry limits. Output includes chronological history of all git operations.

### Added

- **Dual-Output Tool Architecture**: All tools now implement a sophisticated dual-output system that provides different perspectives of the same operation:
  - **Structured Content** (`outputSchema`): Type-safe Zod schemas define the complete, machine-readable data structure returned by tool logic. This is the "source of truth" containing all operational details.
  - **Response Formatter** (`responseFormatter`): Transforms structured output into LLM-optimized `ContentBlock[]` arrays. These formatted responses balance human-readable summaries with complete data, ensuring LLMs have full context to answer follow-up questions. Supports markdown formatting, hierarchical organization, and intelligent truncation.
  - **Key Benefit**: Clients can access raw structured data for processing while LLMs receive optimized, contextual narratives—all from a single tool invocation.
- **Architectural Foundation**:
  - **Dependency Injection**: Integrated `tsyringe` for robust dependency injection, decoupling services and tools. A central DI `container` now manages object lifetimes.
  - **Service/Provider Pattern**: Introduced a standardized service and provider pattern (`src/services/`, `src/storage/`) for abstracting external integrations and data persistence.
  - **Declarative Definitions**: Resources and tools are now self-contained, declarative `ToolDefinition` and `ResourceDefinition` objects in `src/mcp-server/tools/definitions/` and `src/mcp-server/resources/definitions/`, respectively. This simplifies registration and improves modularity.
- **Core Utilities**:
  - **Observability**: Added `performance` and `telemetry` utilities for tracing and metrics, including `measureToolExecution` for automatic performance tracking.
  - **Runtime Helpers**: New utilities for runtime detection (`isBun`, `isCloudflareWorker`) and startup banners.
  - **Health Checks**: A new internal health check utility for verifying service status.
- **Authorization**: Implemented `withToolAuth` and `withResourceAuth` wrapper functions to apply scope-based authorization declaratively to tools and resources.
- **Build & Development**:
  - **Bun**: Fully migrated to `bun` for dependency management, scripting, and runtime execution, replacing `npm` and `tsx`.
  - **Devcheck Script**: Added a new `devcheck` script (`scripts/devcheck.ts`) for comprehensive quality checks (lint, format, typecheck, audit).

### Changed

- **Major Architectural Refactor**: The entire server has been overhauled to align with the `mcp-ts-template v2.3.5` architecture. This is a breaking change for the internal structure but maintains external API compatibility.
  - **File Structure**: Massively reorganized the `src` directory to enforce a strict separation of concerns, with new top-level directories for `container`, `services`, `storage`, and `mcp-server`.
  - **Tool Registration**: The previous registration system (`registration.ts` files) has been replaced by a barrel export (`index.ts`) in the `definitions` directories, which is automatically consumed by the DI container.
  - **Configuration**: Enhanced `src/config/index.ts` with more detailed Zod validation and runtime-specific configurations.
  - **Transports**: Refactored transport management (`src/mcp-server/transports/`) with a unified `TransportManager` and a clear `ITransport` interface.
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling logic into `src/utils/internal/error-handler/`, improving consistency.

### Removed

- **Legacy Tool Structure**: Deleted the entire old tool directory structure (`src/mcp-server/tools/[toolName]/{index.ts, logic.ts, registration.ts}`). All tools were rewritten as declarative definitions.
- **Legacy Resource Structure**: Deleted the old resource directory structure for `gitWorkingDir`.
- **Legacy Transport Core**: Removed outdated transport management files from `src/mcp-server/transports/core/`.
- **Build & Config Files**: Removed `package-lock.json`, `.ncurc.json`, `Dockerfile`, and `tsconfig.typedoc.json`, which are no longer needed with the `bun`-based workflow.

## v2.3.5 - 2025-09-29

### Changed

- **Tooling**:
  - The `git_commit` tool now correctly handles cases where there are no changes to commit, returning a `nothingToCommit: true` status instead of throwing an error.
  - The `git_status` tool's schema is now more flexible (`.passthrough()`) to prevent validation errors on encountering unexpected Git status identifiers.
- **Dependencies**: Updated various dependencies, including `@hono/node-server`, `@types/node`, `typescript-eslint`, and `typescript`.
- **CI/CD**: Minor formatting adjustments in the `publish.yml` GitHub Actions workflow.

### Removed

- **Legacy Files**: Deleted `mcp.json`, `docs/publishing-mcp-server-registry.md`, and `scripts/validate-mcp-publish-schema.ts`, which were part of an outdated publishing workflow.

## v2.3.4 - 2025-09-26

### Removed

- **Publishing**: Removed the manual publishing script (`scripts/validate-mcp-publish-schema.ts`) and associated documentation (`docs/publishing-mcp-server-registry.md`). The `mcp.json` file, related to the old workflow, has also been deleted. This streamlines the publishing process.

### Added

- **Custom Instructions**: The `git_wrapup_instructions` tool can now load custom instructions from an external Markdown file. The file path can be specified using the `GIT_WRAPUP_INSTRUCTIONS_PATH` environment variable.

### Changed

- **Instructions**: Enhanced the default `git_wrapup_instructions` to be more authoritative and include an example task list.
- **Dependencies**: Updated various dependencies to their latest versions, including `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`, `openai`, `tsx`, and `typescript-eslint`.

## v2.3.3 - 2025-09-15

### Added

- **Code Improvement**:
  - Modified `src/utils/metrics/tokenCounter.ts` to explicitly check `tool_call.type === "function"` before accessing function-specific properties; improves robustness for different tool call types.

## v2.3.2 - 2025-07-31

### Feature

- **Enhanced Tool Feedback**: Implemented an enhancement across multiple core Git tools to provide immediate, contextual feedback on the repository's state. The following tools now include the complete, structured output of `git status` in their JSON response upon successful execution:
  - `git_add`
  - `git_checkout`
  - `git_cherry_pick`
  - `git_clean`
  - `git_commit`
  - `git_merge`
  - `git_pull`
  - `git_rebase`
  - `git_reset`
  - `git_stash`
    This change allows agents and clients to instantly verify the outcome of an operation without needing to make a subsequent call to `git_status`.

### Chore

- **Build & Configuration**:
  - **ESLint**: Updated `eslint.config.js` to add `coverage/`, `dist/`, `logs/`, and `data/` to the ignored paths, preventing linting of generated or irrelevant files.
  - **MCP Configuration**: Modified `mcp.json` to use `npx @cyanheads/git-mcp-server` as the execution command, simplifying server startup and removing the need for a local build.
- **Dependencies**:
  - Bumped the package version to `2.3.2` in `package.json` and `package-lock.json`.
- **Testing**:
  - Performed minor refactoring in `tests/utils/internal/errorHandler.test.ts` and `tests/utils/internal/logger.test.ts` to align with recent code modifications and improve test clarity.

## v2.3.1 - 2025-07-31

### Added

- **Testing**:
  - Added a comprehensive test suite covering authentication (`auth.test.ts`, `authUtils.test.ts`, `oauthStrategy.test.ts`), core utilities (`errorHandler.test.ts`, `logger.test.ts`, `requestContext.test.ts`), and transports (`stdioTransport.test.ts`).
  - Integrated `msw` for mocking API requests during tests.
  - Added `@vitest/coverage-v8` for generating code coverage reports.
- **CI/CD**:
  - Added `logs/` to `.gitignore` to prevent log files from being committed.

### Changed

- **Error Handling**:
  - Improved `ErrorHandler` to provide more specific and consistent error messages.
  - Enhanced `jwtStrategy.ts` and `oauthStrategy.ts` to re-throw structured `McpError`s, ensuring consistent error propagation.
- **Logging**:
  - Refactored the `Logger` class in `logger.ts` to be exportable and added a `resetForTesting` method to support isolated test runs.
  - Corrected the parameter order in a `logger.fatal` call within `httpTransport.ts` for better error reporting.
- **Dependencies**:
  - Updated `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` to `^1.17.1`.
  - Updated various development dependencies to their latest versions.

### Fixed

- **Path Sanitization**: Improved path validation in `sanitization.ts` to explicitly disallow null bytes, enhancing security.
- **Git Log Parsing**: Corrected the field destructuring in `gitLog/logic.ts` to prevent potential errors when parsing commit bodies.

## v2.3.0 - 2025-07-31

### Added

- **Development Tooling**:
  - **`tsx`**: Replaced `ts-node` with `tsx` for significantly faster TypeScript execution in development, improving the developer workflow.
  - **ESLint**: Integrated ESLint with TypeScript support (`typescript-eslint`) to enforce code quality, catch potential errors, and maintain a consistent coding style across the project. A new `eslint.config.js` file has been added.
  - **TypeDoc**: Added TypeDoc for generating comprehensive API documentation from JSDoc comments. New configuration files (`typedoc.json`, `tsconfig.typedoc.json`, `tsdoc.json`) have been included.
- **Scripts**:
  - Added new npm scripts: `lint`, `lint:fix`, `typecheck`, `dev`, `dev:stdio`, `dev:http`, `audit`, and `audit:fix` to support the new tooling and improve development workflows.
  - Added `scripts/fetch-openapi-spec.ts` to download and save API specifications.
  - Added `scripts/README.md` to document the utility scripts.

### Changed

- **Core Refactoring**:
  - **Architectural Alignment**: The entire codebase has been refactored to strictly adhere to the "Logic Throws, Handler Catches" principle, improving separation of concerns and error handling consistency.
  - **JSDoc**: Added comprehensive JSDoc comments to all core files, tools, utilities, and scripts, enabling clear API documentation and better maintainability.
  - **Type Safety**: Replaced ambiguous `any` types with specific, inferred types from Zod schemas, enhancing type safety throughout the application.
- **Logging & Error Handling**:
  - **`RequestContext`**: Consistently passed `RequestContext` through the entire call stack for improved traceability and contextual logging.
  - **`ErrorHandler`**: Centralized error handling to use the `ErrorHandler` utility and structured `McpError` objects for consistent, machine-readable error responses.
- **Dependencies**:
  - Updated all major dependencies, including `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`, `hono`, `zod`, and `winston`.
  - Added new development dependencies like `eslint`, `typescript-eslint`, `tsx`, and `typedoc`.

## v2.2.4 - 2025-07-29

### Added

- **Git Working Directory Resource**: Introduced a new resource, `git://working-directory`, which allows clients to retrieve the currently configured working directory for a session. This enhances contextual awareness for tools and agents interacting with the server.

### Changed

- **Documentation**: Updated `README.md` to include the new "Resources" section, documenting the `git://working-directory` resource. Also updated the version badge to `2.2.4`.

## v2.2.3 - 2025-07-29

### Added

- **Testing Framework**: Initial setup of Vitest testing framework for unit and integration testing. Added initial test setup, configurations (`vitest.config.ts`, `tsconfig.vitest.json`), and coverage reporting.
- **Git Signing**: Implemented automatic GPG/SSH signing for commit-creating operations (`git_commit`, `git_merge`, `git_cherry_pick`, `git_tag`) when `GIT_SIGN_COMMITS=true` is set. Includes a fallback to unsigned commits on signing failure.

### Changed

- **mcp-ts-template Alignment**: Updated the server to align with the latest changes in the [`mcp-ts-template` v1.7.7](https://github.com/cyanheads/mcp-ts-template/releases/tag/v1.7.7), including improvements to the project structure and configuration.
- **Configuration Overhaul**: Completely refactored `src/config/index.ts`. It now uses Zod for robust, type-safe validation of all environment variables, provides clear startup errors for misconfigurations, and automatically determines the project root.
- **Authentication Architecture**: Refactored the entire authentication system to use a strategy pattern.
  - Created `JwtStrategy` and `OauthStrategy` classes implementing a common `AuthStrategy` interface.
  - A new `authFactory` selects the strategy based on configuration.
  - A unified `authMiddleware` now delegates verification to the selected strategy, decoupling the transport layer from authentication logic.
- **Transport Layer Abstraction**: Decoupled the Hono web server from the MCP SDK's transport logic.
  - Introduced `StatefulTransportManager` and `StatelessTransportManager` to handle all session and request lifecycle logic.
  - The Hono `httpTransport` is now a thin layer responsible for routing, middleware, and bridging Hono's web streams with the SDK's Node.js streams. Streamable HTTP should work much better now.
  - This refactoring resulted in a major file reorganization within `src/mcp-server/transports/`.
- **Error Handling**: Improved the `ErrorHandler` to prevent mutation of original error objects and added several new `BaseErrorCode`s for more precise error reporting.

### Dependencies

- **Added**: `vitest`, `@vitest/coverage-v8`, `supertest`, `msw`, `@faker-js/faker` and other testing-related packages.
- **Updated**: `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` to `^1.17.0`, `hono` to `^4.8.10`, and various other dependencies.

## v2.2.1 - 2025-07-17

### Changed

- **Error Handling Refactor**: Executed a comprehensive, mandatory refactoring across all Git tools to strictly enforce the "Logic Throws, Handler Catches" architectural principle. All `try...catch` blocks have been removed from the `logic.ts` files. The logic layer now exclusively throws structured `McpError`s on failure, while the `registration.ts` handler layer is solely responsible for catching and processing these errors. This ensures a clean separation of concerns and standardizes the error handling pipeline.
- **Structured Error Responses**: Updated all tool registration handlers to return a structured error object in the `structuredContent` field upon failure, including the `code`, `message`, and `details` of the `McpError`. This provides richer, machine-readable error context to the MCP client.
- **Dependency Updates**: Updated `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` to `^1.16.0` and `openai` to `^5.10.1`.
- **Configuration**: Added `zod` to the reject list in `.ncurc.json` to prevent unintended upgrades.

## v2.2.0 - 2025-07-16

### Fixed

- **Validation Enforcement**: Corrected a critical flaw in two tool registration handlers (`gitTag`, `gitWorktree`) where the base Zod schema was used for registration instead of the refined schema. This meant that conditional validation rules (e.g., required fields for specific modes) were not being enforced. The handlers now explicitly parse incoming parameters with the full, refined schema, ensuring all validation logic is correctly applied before execution.

### Changed

- **Architectural Refactor**: Aligned the entire server with the latest architectural standards and the MCP specification (2025-06-18). This includes:
  - **Standardized Schemas**: All tools now use explicit Zod schemas for both input and output, ensuring type safety and clear data contracts. This enables structured output, a newer feature of the MCP specification. Not all MCP Clients support structured output so we keep backwards compatibility by returning stringified JSON.
  - **Logic/Handler Separation**: Core tool logic is now isolated in `logic.ts` files, with error handling managed by a dedicated `ErrorHandler` in the `registration.ts` handlers. This enforces the 'Logic Throws, Handler Catches' principle.
  - **Simplified State Management**: Removed state accessor initializers in favor of passing `getWorkingDirectory` and `getSessionId` functions directly to tool registration, cleaning up the server initialization process.
- **Tool Response Cleanup**: Refactored `git_push` and `git_pull` tools to remove redundant `summary` fields from their output, providing a cleaner and more concise response.
- **Tool Annotations**: Added descriptive annotations to all tool registrations to provide richer metadata to the client/LLM, improving tool discovery and usage.

### Dependencies

### Fixed

- Downgraded `dotenv` to `^16.6.1` to suppress `dotenvx` promotional logging messages in v17.0 that were interfering with the stdio transport.
- Added `dotenv` to the `reject` list in `.ncurc.json` to prevent future automatic upgrades to problematic versions.

## v2.1.7 - 2025-06-29

### Changed

- Suppressed `dotenv` debug output to prevent interference with the stdio transport.
- Updated the fallback package name in the configuration for better error identification.

## v2.1.5 - 2025-06-29

### Security

- Patched a command injection vulnerability where unsanitized user input could be passed to `child_process.exec`. All `exec` calls have been replaced with the safer `execFile` method, which treats arguments as distinct values rather than executable script parts. Thank you to [@dellalibera](https://github.com/dellalibera) for the disclosure. For more details, see the security advisory: [GHSA-3q26-f695-pp76](https://github.com/cyanheads/git-mcp-server/security/advisories/GHSA-3q26-f695-pp76).

## v2.1.4 - 2025-06-20

### Changed

- **HTTP Transport Layer**: Migrated the entire HTTP transport from Express to Hono for improved performance and a more modern API. This includes new middleware for CORS, rate limiting, and error handling.
- **Authentication Architecture**: Refactored the authentication system into a modular, strategy-based architecture.
  - Supports both JWT and OAuth 2.1 bearer token validation.
  - Configuration is managed via `MCP_AUTH_MODE` environment variable.
  - Uses `AsyncLocalStorage` for safer, context-aware access to authentication info.
- **Session Management**: Simplified session state management by centralizing the working directory logic within the main server instance, removing transport-specific state handlers.

## v2.1.3 - 2025-06-20

### Changed

- (docs) Updated `README.md` to improve clarity, add a core capabilities table, and reflect new dependency versions.

### Changed

- (tools) Refactored error handling across all Git tools to use structured `McpError` exceptions with specific `BaseErrorCode`s (e.g., `CONFLICT`, `NOT_FOUND`, `VALIDATION_ERROR`) instead of returning `{ success: false, ... }` objects. This provides more consistent and machine-readable error responses.
- (tools) Improved logging across all Git tools for better traceability and debugging, ensuring structured context is always included.
- (tools) Refined success and result objects for several tools (`gitPull`, `gitPush`, `gitMerge`, etc.) to be more consistent and structured.

- (logging) Refactored internal logger (`utils/internal/logger.ts`):
  - Deferred informational setup messages (e.g., logs directory creation, console logging status) to use the logger's own `info()` method after Winston is initialized.
  - Made critical pre-initialization `console.error` and `console.warn` calls conditional on TTY to prevent non-JSONRPC output when running in stdio mode with an MCP client.
  - Extracted console formatting logic into a reusable helper function (`createWinstonConsoleFormat`) to reduce duplication.
  - Added comments explaining TTY-conditional logging for clarity.

This includes updated JSDoc, standardized error handling within sanitization, and minor refactors to other sanitization functions. (5b5e037)
- (gitDiff) The 'diff' field in the `gitDiff` tool's response now includes the string "No changes found." directly when no differences are detected, ensuring consistent output format. (5b5e037)

### Other

## v2.0.8 - 2025-05-07

### Fixed

- Resolved issue where Windows drive letters could be stripped from absolute paths during sanitization when `allowAbsolute` was not explicitly true.
